# Edge

This folder includes subfolders with deifferent edge devices. Different edge devices have a little different code since they all have different prerequisites. Today we have code optimized for two different edge devices:
* Sailor
* R/V Svea
It is possible to run the same packages on similar sailing drones and research vessels. With that said, it is probably necessary to create new strcutures for other edge devices like different vessels.
